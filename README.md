# curses demo

At this point of development, it is not really a game (yet?).
I'm currently just experimenting with curses.

## How to run

1. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10
2. Inside this new venv, do `pip install -e .`
3. Run:

```
python3 src/cg/
```

## How to use

- Walk in any direction using the arrow keys.
- To run, press `Shift` simultaneously.
- Pressing `Enter` quits the program.
